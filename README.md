# Digital-Forensics-Demonstration-Number-8
This is a repo for the Digital Forensics class at Northwest Missouri State University. It is specifically for Demonstration Number 8, involving working with the Belkasoft Evidence Center. The specific topic for the demonstration is the cloud while using Belkasoft. 


Welcome!
My name is Colton Wilson and I am a junior at Northwest Missouri State University. Above is a little description of what this repository was created for. The rest of the ReadMe will contain the steps I took in exploring the Belkasoft Evidence Center and what it is about.

## Step 1: Downloading Belkasoft Evidence Center
The first step is to download the evidence center software itself. To start, go to the following link to download the software: https://belkasoft.com/ec. This is the page you will land on: ![Belkasoft Main Page](dfbec1.PNG)

The next thing to do is to click on the "Download Now" box on the right of the screen. The next screen you will be taken to is this: ![Belkasoft Email Screen](dfbec2.PNG)

After you enter in your business email, the last screen you will be taken to is this: ![Belkasoft Information Screen](dfbec3.PNG)

This screen asks for your information so Belkasoft can create a request to download their software. After you enter the necessary information, the company will process your information and approve or deny your request for the download within one business day.
